# DEPRECATED
This remains to provide support for older versions of roc-start which depend on the scripts folder, but has been replaced by the `plugins` directory, will be removed eventually. New plugins will not be added to the scripts directory. To get the latest plugins, update to roc-start version >= `v0.7.1`, and run `roc-start update --plugins`.
